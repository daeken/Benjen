#title Demo a week, week 2: Armitage
#date 2010-04-02

# 

Well, this demo is coming a bit late. After days of fighting with OpenGL and GLSL, I finally have a demo that's fairly presentable. It's still not great (by any means), but it's an improvement over last week's demo and that's the goal. Sadly, this week's demo has compatibility issues out the ass -- I suddenly understand why everyone goes D3D for the demoscene. My next demo will almost definitely be D3D10, due to familiarity and geometry shaders. We'll see.

Anyway, you can get the build at . If you give it a shot, let me know what video card you're using and whether it worked or not. I'll be releasing the source in the next day or two if anyone wants to play with it, and as always, the NFO is below.

Oh, and note: I couldn't make it less dependent on framerate this time around, but it's a ton faster than the last demo, so I'm not going to beat myself up over it. Next demo will be framerate-independent, I promise...

Happy Hacking,

                        - April 2, 2010
    
    Week 2 of my demo-a-week project is upon us.  I tend to think this is a much
    better demo than the last one, even if it is short.  It has known compatibility
    issues (older ATI cards, like the one in my desktop, seem to dislike my vertex
    shaders...) and it'ss fairly short, but I like it a lot more than Waveride.
    
    I was planning on making this one cross-platform, but after dealing with tons
    of compatibility issues, I figure it's better for my mental health if I didn't.
    The source will be made available in case anyone feels like doing something fun
    with it.
    
    Waveride used Miriel by Nightbeat as its music, on suggestion from a friend of 
    mine.  Oddly enough, Nightbeat produced a song called Straylight -- I got the 
    name from Neuromancer, but I can only take that as a good sign.  Anyway, enough
    rambling.
    
    Compatibility:
    Tested on a GeForce 9400M, but should work with most modern cards.  Requires
    SM3.0 (I believe) and rendering to a floating point framebuffer object.  If it
    dies on start or you don't see the pretty spheres, one of those things is 
    likely the issue.
