#title Straytex: Online procedural texture studio
#date 2010-03-27

In the course of working on my next demo for my [demo-a-week][1] project, I'm doing a lot of procedural texture generation. The ability to quickly test modifications to my algorithms is crucial, so I decided to whip up a simple texture editor, Straytex (named after Straylight, my demogroup).

It likely only works on the latest Chrome dev channel build (edit: also works on Safari and Firefox, but I'm not sure which versions) and is ugly as sin (if anyone wants to help out with either of these issues, it'd be greatly appreciated!), but it gets the job done. At the moment, the interface is pretty simple: you can select the texture size, change the random seed, modify the source, and tag your changes. The tag feature is especially handy -- you often accidentally stumble onto cool effects, so the ability to tag these to go back to them later is insanely useful.

You can see it live [here][2], and check the source out on [Github][3]. I hope you enjoy it.
