It's a new year, so it's time for a quick wrapup post.

# Last Year

*   Obviously the big thing was my [Black Hat USA talk][1] on breaking hotel locks. The attention it's received has been insane; I never expected anyone outside the lock industry to care about it, but it's been featured in every major publication and even on national TV. Quite an experience.
*   I spent February-December working for Mozilla on the Boot2Gecko/Firefox OS project. Lots of interesting experiences and a great team.
*   In November I built QtzWeb, the first Quartz Composer implementation not by Apple, compiling it to JS WebGL. I released the [first demo][2] using it at Kindergarden, and dropped the [source on Github][3] recently.

# This Year

*   As always, I have something new and interesting brewing, which I'll be showing off in the next few months.
*   I have an upcoming series of posts on getting into security, of which you can [read a preview](https://gist.github.com/b03f0b1f26fc1a98ca51).
*   I started work at Accuvant LABS, where I'm a Senior Security Consultant.
*   I'm going to be splitting my time between the middle of nowhere in Connecticut, and Barcelona, starting in April.
*   QtzWeb -- the previously mentioned project -- is getting a web-based editor to cut Quartz Composer out of the picture entirely. This has a lot of potential for interactive 3d content on the web.

I'll be posting some more in-depth blog posts soon, but in the meantime have a happy 2013, and thanks to everyone for their support over the last year!

Happy Hacking,
